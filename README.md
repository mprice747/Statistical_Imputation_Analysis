# Statistical_Imputation_Analysis
This project is an investigation of various statistical imputation techniques for use in machine learning. We discuss and implement various msny imputation techniques, like MICE, MissForest and KNN, and see how they affect the accruacy of various machine learning algorithms. In addiion, we also propose an ensemble imputation technique to limit the amount of imputed datasets while also minimizing variance.

Our results show that no one imputation technique proves superior and that numberous imputation techniques should be investigated when one faces missing data.

The code from the project is located in the analysis folder. Code for the hyperparameter tuning on each of the datasets is located in the Dataset_Analysis subdirectory. Code for imputation experiment is located in the Imputation_Analysis subdirectory. The three datasets used for this project are located in the data folder. Plots from the paper are located in the plots folder, and all the results from our experiments are located in the results folders.

This project was the final project for Rice University's STAT 413 - Intro to Statistical Machine Learning class.
